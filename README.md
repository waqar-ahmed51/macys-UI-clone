# macys-UI-clone
For practice created the clone of 'https://www.macys.com/shop/search?keyword=jeans'.
I created this during my internship program at NISUM Karachi. This repository is made for record purpose.
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap in this clone.

Here are some screenshots of the output.
